In honor of National Hazing Prevention Week, Psi Chapter of the Kappa Phi Lambda Sorority, Inc. is taking a strong stance against hazing. Hazing has no place in our sisterhood. These hands are for lifting each other up, empowering and supporting each other, and comforting each other in times of need. ⁣⁣
These hands don’t haze!⁣
